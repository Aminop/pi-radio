##Pi-Radio

Simple wrapper for mpd to serve rest/json kind of api with minimalistic web ui. Working just fine on my RPi.

Can be extended to support not mpd only but other backends, for example Pianobar (to play Pandora). Another nice extension I have in mind - podcast player.

###Requirements:

* python >= 2.6
* [web.py](http://webpy.org)
* [python-mpd2](https://github.com/Mic92/python-mpd2)
* [mpd](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki)
